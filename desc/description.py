#  What is Django?

# Django is a high-level Python web framework used to build secure, scalable, and fast web applications.
# It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, helping developers build websites quickly without needing to reinvent basic components like authentication, database handling, or admin panels.

#  Key Features of Django
